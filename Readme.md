# File Compression with zlib and base64

This Python script demonstrates how to compress text data using the zlib library and then encode the compressed data in base64. It also includes handling cases where the "comp.txt" file either exists or doesn't exist.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

3. Create a text file named "test.txt" in the same directory with the text data you want to compress.

## Usage

Run the Python script to compress the text data and save it to "comp.txt." The code checks if "comp.txt" already exists and contains data before overwriting it.

```python
python main.py
The compressed and base64-encoded data will be stored in "comp.txt."

Dependencies
Python (Tested with Python 3.x)
